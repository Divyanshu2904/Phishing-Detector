# Phishing-Detector
AI-powered real-time phishing website detector using machine learning and browser automation.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Real-time URL scanning using live data  
✅ 48 intelligent features extracted per URL (DNS, SSL, WHOIS, Playwright, etc.)
✅ Detects phishing websites using Random Forest classifier 
✅ Flask REST API for ML model predictions
✅ Integrated Flask backend with API for predictions  
✅ Chrome Extension to alert users during browsing  
✅ WHOIS, SSL, DNS, content, and Playwright-based behavior analysis  
✅ Custom dataset training support  
✅ Accurate, fast, and privacy-respecting
✅ Works with browser extension for instant scan

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User visits any website
2. Extension sends the URL to Flask backend
3. Feature extractor gathers 48 real-time signals:
   - DNS, SSL, WHOIS, page content, suspicious words, etc.
4. ML model predicts `phishing` or `legit` based on those features
5. Result is shown with confidence score on extension popup


## ⚙️ Installation

Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies
Bash:
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Train the ML Model 
Step 3: Start Flask API
Base:
python app.py

Step 4: Load Chrome Extension

Open chrome://extensions/
Enable Developer Mode
Click Load unpacked
Select the extension folder

## 🧠 What You Learn

- How to extract phishing indicators in real time
- How to use browser automation for security tasks
- How to build your own phishing detection API
- Full ML + browser extension integration


📌Note:
1).Internet connection is required during training and scanning for real-time features (WHOIS, DNS, content).
2).This tool performs client-side prediction and does not collect any user data.
3).The prediction happens locally via your browser and local API server.
4).Your browsing history is never sent to any external server.
